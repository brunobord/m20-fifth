# M20 Fifth: Adamantine Edition

[TOC]

## What is This?

This is a trimmed-down, subminiature version of the Fifth Edition of the World's Most Popular Role-playing game (see license for more info) that has been designed to be quick and easy to play.

The goal was to create a simpler game, but one where all of the resources of the Fifth Edition (monsters, spells, adventures and equipment) could be used without conversion.

## Getting Started

Get a group of 2-6 people together with some dice, paper, and pencils. One player is the **Game Master (GM)**, who runs all of the **non-player characters (NPCs)**, describes the environment, and determines the outcome of rolls. The rest of the players make one **character**.

Agree upon a **game concept**, and then each player creates a **character concept** that fits. The game is largely played through a dialogue, the players describe their character's attempted actions and the GM calls for what rolls or rules are necessary.

A group of characters is usually called a **party** or a **group**. Your party will interact with each other, the NPCs, and the universe, all under the guidance of the GM, the dice, and the rules.

All you need to play are these rules, a set of polyhedral dice, and something to take notes on. Every player should at least have a passing understanding of the rules, and the GM should know enough to make characters and run the basics.

### Polyhedral Dice

This game uses dice with 4, 8, 10, 12 and 20 sides in addition to the usual six-sided dice. The usual notation for dice is XdY, which means roll X dice with Y sides. (2d6 is two six-sided dice, 1d12 is one twelve-sided dice.) If you do not have a set of polyhedral dice, the following approximations with d6's will get you close enough in a pinch:

| d4                               | d8   | d10  | d12  | d20  |
| :-----------------------------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| d6-1,<br />or d6 (reroll 5/6)     | d6+1 | d6+2 | 2d6 | 3d6<br />(16-18 crits) |

### Explanatory Notes

M20 Fifth will be easiest to understand if you are already familiar with RPGs. For the unfamiliar reader, the following brief explanations are offered:

<small>**Stats** (aka Ability Scores) and **Skills**: Numerical representations of a character's raw physical/mental abilities and training in specific areas, respectively. Corresponds to a bonus, which is added to rolls.</small>
<small>**Race**: The fantasy species a character belongs to.</small>
<small>**Class**: A collection of talents and abilities that describe a character's profession or role as an adventurer.</small>
<small>**Level**: Has two different meanings, that shouldn't be confused. **Character level** is a reflection of a character's general growth as a result of earning **experience points (XP)** from overcoming obstacles. **Spell level** is the measure of a spell's relative power.</small>

## Characters

### Stats

There are 3 stats : Strength (**STR**), Dexterity (**DEX**) and Mind (**MIND**).

Roll 4d6, drop lowest die. Total remaining 3 dice and allocate to one of the stats. Repeat for remaining stats.

Alternatively you may use the array of 15, 12, 8.

Stat bonus = (STAT-10)/2, round down.

### Races

**Humans**: +1 to all Stats

**Magical Races** (e.g. Elves, Gnomes): +2 MIND

**Tough Races** (e.g. Dwarves, Half-Orcs, Dragonborn): +2 STR

**Quick Races** (e.g. Halflings): +2 DEX

### Classes

The classes are **Fighter**, **Rogue**, **Mage** and **Cleric**.
Characters start at level 1 with a **proficiency bonus** of +2.

#### Fighter

**Skill and Save Proficiencies**: Physical, STR Saves
**Armor Proficiencies**: All armor, Shield
**Improved Stamina**: +3 to HP per level. When taking short rests, add 3 hp per rest dice spent.
**Multiple Attacks**: You gain an additional attack at 5th level, and again at 11th and 20th level.
**Extended Crit Range**: At level 3 you crit on a 19-20. At level 15 you crit on an 18-20.
**Extra Ability Score Increase**: At level 14, you get an extra ability score increase.
**Starting Equipment**: chain mail (+6 AC heavy armor), shield, one weapon (and ammunition if applicable), 10 gp, a fast pack (see Equipment)

#### Rogue

**Skill and Save Proficiencies**: Subterfuge, DEX saves
**Armor Proficiencies**: Light armor
**Sneak Attack**: Whenever you have advantage, or your target is distracted by melee combat with another foe you may add [half level, rounded up]d6 to your damage.
**Cunning Action**: As a bonus action, you may make a Subterfuge check or Dash.
**Starting Equipment**: leather armor (+1 AC light armor), one weapon (and ammunition if applicable), thieves tools, 15 gp, a fast pack (see Equipment)

#### Mage

**Skill and Save Proficiencies**: Knowledge, MIND Saves
**Armor Proficiencies**: No armor
**Signature Spell**: Choose one spell (or one action-realm combination if using Words of Power.) Casting this spell costs 1 MP less.
**Arcane Spellcasting**: See Magic for more information.
**Starting Equipment**: spellbook, wand, 10 gp, a fast pack (see Equipment)

#### Cleric

**Skill and Save Proficiencies**: Communication, MIND Saves
**Armor Proficiencies**: Medium Armor, Shield
**Divine Spellcasting**: See Magic for more information.
**Channel Divinity**: You have the ability to channel positive energy once per short/long rest to Turn Undead or Preserve Life. At level 6 this becomes twice per rest, and at level 18 this becomes three times per rest. To **Turn Undead** the cleric brandishes their holy symbol forcing all undead within 30 feet to make a MIND save (DC 8 + cleric's MIND bonus + cleric's proficiency) or flee. If the undead roll a 1 on their save, they are immediately destroyed. **Preserve Life** restores [5 * level] hp divided to taste among allies within 30 feet.
**Starting Equipment**: scale mail (+4 AC medium armor), shield, holy symbol, mace (one-handed weapon), 15 gp, a fast pack (see Equipment)

### Backgrounds

Every character should also choose a background, which grants them proficiency in one skill, and grounds them in the world. Every background provides a great starting point for role-playing. Perhaps a criminal has underworld contacts, perhaps a soldier can still get respect among patriotic peasants, perhaps a sage can easily find obscure information in books when they need to.

**Communication Backgrounds**: Acolyte, Noble, Folk Hero, etc.
**Subterfuge Backgrounds**: Criminal, Urchin, Charlatan, etc.
**Knowledge Backgrounds**: Sage, Hermit, etc.
**Physical Backgrounds**: Soldier, Sailor, etc.


> **Optional Rule (Specialization)**: If a character has a background which grants a proficiency which they already get from their class, they may add twice their proficiency bonus to d20 rolls.


### Skills and Saving Throws

There are just 4 skills : **Physical**, **Subterfuge**, **Knowledge** and **Communication**. Roll equal to or higher than the given Difficulty Class (**DC**) or opposed roll to succeed.

**Skill/Saving Throw roll = d20 + stat bonus + (proficiency bonus)**

For example, Climbing would use STR + Physical bonus. Dodging a falling rock is DEX + Physical bonus. Finding a trap is MIND + Subterfuge bonus. Disabling a trap is DEX + Subterfuge bonus.

**Common DC's**

* **Very easy**: 5
* **Easy**: 10
* **Moderate**: 15
* **Hard**: 20
* **Very hard**: 25
* **Nearly impossible**: 30

#### Advantage and Disadvantage

Whenever a character has increased or decreased odds of succeeding on a d20 roll, the GM may elect to give that character Advantage or Disadvantage. This involves rolling twice and taking the better or worse of the two rolls respectively.


## Magic

All casters have Magic Points (MP) equal to their max HP. They may cast spells of a level equal to ½ their class level, rounded up. Use the spells from Appendix B, or the spell system described in Appendix C. Alternatively, let casters know 6 spells of any spell level they have access to from the Fifth Edition Basic Rules.

**Concentration**: Certain spells require concentration. While concentrating on a spell, a caster may not cast other concentration spells. If a caster is hit while concentrating on a spell, they must make a DC 10 or half the damage taken (whichever is higher) MIND save or the spell fizzles.

Casting a spell of any kind requires magic points. The cost is:
**1 + double the level of the spell being cast**

| Spell Level | MP Cost |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 1           | 3       |
| 2           | 5       |
| 3           | 7       |
| 4           | 9       |
| 5           | 11      |
| 6           | 13      |
| 7           | 15      |
| 8           | 17      |
| 9           | 19      |

The DC for saving throws to resist a caster's spell is:
**8 + MIND bonus + proficiency bonus**

> **Optional Rules**
>
> * **Blood Magic**: Instead of having MP equal to their HP, a caster has MP equal to half their HP. In addition, a caster may choose convert their HP to MP at a rate of 2 HP per 1 MP.
> * **Ritual Casting**: A caster may cast any spell without expending MP if they take an additional 10 minutes casting the spell.

### Cantrips

A caster starts with knowledge of [MIND bonus] cantrips, which may be any combination of damaging and utility cantrips. A cantrip is a spell that can be cast again and again without any MP cost.

#### Damaging Cantrips

You may make a damaging cantrip using the table below - a damaging cantrip may add up to at most 9 points and must have a range, damage and method. At levels 5, 11 and 17 they do an additional dice of damage. (If a cantrip has separate beams, instead of additional dice of damage at these levels, you get an additional beam which can target separate creatures.)

| Points | Range | Damage | Method       | Additional Effects     |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1      | Touch | 1d4    | Magic Attack | Seperate beams         |
| 2      | 10'   | 1d6    | DEX save     | Pull 10' closer to you |
| 3      | 30'   | 1d8    | MIND save    |                        |
| 4      | 60'   | 1d10   |              |                        |
| 5      | 120'  | 1d12   |              |                        |

>  **Optional Rule (Damage Type)**: In addition to the effects mentioned on the table, choose any one damage type your cantrip qualifies for based on its range:
>
> * Touch: Lightning (Advantage if target wearing metal armor)
> * 10 ft or less: Poison
> * 30 ft or less: Piercing
> * 60 ft or less: Radiant, Psychic, Acid
> * 120 ft or less: Necrotic, Force, Fire


#### Utility Cantrips

Instead of damaging cantrips, you may choose one of the following utility cantrips:

**Prestidigitation**: Perform minor tricks for 1 hour.
**Ghost Sound**: Figment sounds for 1 minute.
**Mage Hand**: 5-pound telekinesis. Lasts until concentration ends.
**Light**: Object shines like a torch for 1 hour.
**Guidance**: Subject gets +1d4 on one skill check. Lasts for one minute or until discharged.
**Resistance**: Subject gets +1d4 on one saving throw. Lasts for one minute or until discharged.

## Combat

Hit Points = (1d8 + STR bonus)/Level. If HP reaches 0, unconscious and near death. Every round, make unmodified d20 rolls to avoid death. DC 10, must get three successes before three failures.

Roll d20 + DEX bonus for initiative order. Everyone can move (30 ft.) and perform an action each turn. Actions include: additional movement (dashing), casting a spell and attacking. In addition, a single bonus action may be taken if granted by a class feature, spell or other ability.

**Melee attack bonus = STR bonus + proficiency bonus**
**Missile attack bonus = DEX bonus + proficiency bonus**
**Magic attack bonus = MIND bonus + proficiency bonus**

Add attack bonus to d20 roll. If equal to or higher than your opponent's Armour Class (AC), it's a hit. Natural 20 is automatically a critical hit doing double damage.

Add STR bonus to melee damage, and DEX bonus to missile damage.

**Armour Class (AC) = 10 + Armour bonus + (DEX bonus).**

> **Optional Rules**
>
> * **Finesse**: Fighters and Rogues can use DEX bonus + proficiency bonus as Melee attack bonus and damage instead if wielding a light weapon.
> * **Dual Wielding**: Fighters and Rogues can wield 2 light weapons and may use an action to attack with their main weapon, and a bonus action to attack with their offhand weapon. Don't add your ability modifier to the damage on the second weapon.
> * **Great Weapon Fighting**: When a Fighter or Rogue is wielding a two-handed weapon, they may re-roll 1 and 2 results on their damage dice, but you must use the new roll.

### Natural Healing

Characters have rest dice equal to their level.

A **short rest** is one hour long, and a character may spend rest dice to regain 1d8 + STR bonus hit points per dice. Casters regain [double level] magic points on a short rest.

A **long rest** is 8 hours long. A character regains all hit points and magic points, and half of their total rest dice. Casters regain all magic points on a long rest.

### Improvised Hazards and Traps

Use the below information to improvise damage for things like being pushed into a campfire or falling into lava.

Examples:

* 3d6 - being pushed into a campfire, falling 30 feet
* 6d6 - suffering a cave-in, falling 60 feet
* 28d6 - falling into lava

| Character Level | Minor | Major | Deadly |
| --------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| 1-4             | 2d6   | 3d6   | 6d6    |
| 5-10            | 3d6   | 6d6   | 16d6   |
| 11-16           | 6d6   | 16d6  | 28d6   |
| 17-20           | 16d6  | 28d6  | 38d6   |

## Advancement

After every encounter, add up the Challenge Rating (CR) of every monster, trap, etc. that was overcome. When the total = 10 x your current level, you've advanced to the next level. Reset the total to 0 after advancing.

**Hit Points**: 1d8 + STR bonus per level

**Proficiency Bonus**: 1-4: +2; 5-8: +3; 10-12: +4; 13-16: +5; 1720: +6

**Ability Score Increases (Casters)**: 4, 8, 12, 16, 19

**Ability Score Increases (Non-Casters)**: 4, 8, 10, 12, 16, 19

When a character receives an ability score increase, they either gain +2 to one stat or +1 to two stats (max 20.)

## Bestiary

**Skills and Saving Throws**: Treat a monster's bonus for all skills and saving throws as their attack bonus. Alternatively, assign stats to taste and use stat bonus + (proficiency bonus) as their skill bonus.

## Equipment

### Currency

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces (sp). Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). A platinum piece (pp) is worth 10 gp.

| Exchange       | cp    | sp   | gp    | pp      |
| -------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ------- |
| Copper piece   | 1     | 1/10 | 1/100 | 1/1,000 |
| Silver piece   | 10    | 1    | 1/10  | 1/100   |
| Gold piece     | 100   | 10   | 1     | 1/10    |
| Platinum piece | 1,000 | 100  | 10    | 1       |

### Armor

The cost of armor equals AC bonus times 5, squared.

* **Light Armor**: +1, +2 add DEX bonus
* **Medium Armor**: +3, + 4, +5 add DEX bonus (max 2)
* **Heavy Armor**: +6, +7, +8 no DEX bonus, disadvantage on Subterfuge checks involving stealth
* **Shield** (10 gp): +2

Barding for horses costs 4 times as much as human armor, and weighs twice as much.

### Weapons

Either use weapons from the Basic Rules of Fifth Edition, or use the table below to improvise weapons.

**Weapon Damage by Class (Weapon Cost)**

| Class   | Light<br />(2 gp) | 1-handed<br />(10 gp) | 2-handed<br />(40 gp) | Ranged<br />(†) |
| ------- | :---------------: | --------------------: | :-------------------: | :-------------: |
| Fighter |        1d8        |                  1d10 |         1d12          |       1d8       |
| Rogue   |        1d6        |                   1d8 |          2d6          |       1d8       |
| Mage    |        1d4        |                   1d6 |          1d8          |       1d6       |
| Cleric  |        1d4        |                   1d6 |         1d10          |       1d6       |

† Ranged weapon cost: 50 gp (ammunition-based weapon), 1 gp (20 ammunition) / 1 gp (thrown weapon)

### Other Equipment

To figure out a reasonable price for equipment use the following table (for example, a bedroll would cost 10 gp, since it's two syllables):

| Kind of Item                    | Cost                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Common Items                    | 1 cp x number of syllables   |
| Adventuring/Camping Gear        | 5 gp x number of syllables   |
| Specialist Tools, Animals       | 10 gp x number of syllables  |
| Luxury Items                    | 25 gp x number of syllables  |
| Lethal items, Dangerous Animals | 100 gp x number of syllables |

### Fast Packs

Choose a pack, or roll 1d6 to select one randomly.

* **Pack A** (1-2): backpack, belt pouch, bedroll, hooded lantern, 10 oil flasks, flint & steel, shovel, 2 sets of caltrops, signal whistle, waterskin, iron rations (4 days)
* **Pack B** (3-4): backpack, belt pouch, bedroll, 10 torches, 4 oil flasks, flint & steel, 10 pieces of chalk, 10' pole, mirror, crowbar, waterskin, iron rations (4 days)
* **Pack C** (5-6): backpack, belt pouch, bedroll, tent, 10 torches, 5 oil flasks, flint & steel, 50' rope, grappling hook, 10' pole, waterskin, iron rations (4 days)

## GM Advice: When in doubt... Remember

Whenever the players want to try something that goes around, through, or above and beyond the rules as written, you can always use the "GM's Friend"... the 50% chance. Have them roll whatever check seems most appropriate.

A roll of 1-10 is a failure, a roll of 11-20 is a success. If you feel that the situation warrants that you favor them, assign advantage to their roll. If the situation determines that they be hindered, then assign disadvantage.

## Appendix A: Additional Combat Options

The combat system of M20 Fifth is designed to be as simple and streamlined as possible, but if more complexity is desired the following options are offered:

* **Surprise**: If a creature fails to perceive (MIND + Sub) another creature hiding (DEX + Sub) before a battle, they start combat surprised. A surprised creature is unable to move, take actions or reactions until the first round of combat is finished.
* **Reactions**: A character can make one reaction per round when it is not their turn. Typical reactions include:
  * **Opportunity Attacks**: When an opponent tries to leave your reach without taking the Disengage action (see below), you may make a single attack against them.
  * **Cast Certain Spells**: Spells like Feather Fall from Appendix B or Counterspell from the Fifth Edition Basic Rules can be cast as a reaction instead of an action.
* **Disengage**: A character may take a disengage action in order to safely retreat without provoking an opportunity attack from opponents.
* **Dodge**: A character may take a dodge action, granting disadvantage on all attacks until their next turn.
* **Ready an Action**: Instead of acting on your turn, you may ready an action. Readying an action delays your action until you use a reaction to trigger it later in the round.
* **Knocking a Creature Out**: When an attacker reduces a foe to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker may choose to knock the creature out instead of dealing a lethal blow.
* **Maneuvers**: Maneuvers are special actions that a character can take instead of just attacking. The most common maneuvers are:
  * **Grappling**: Against a target no more than twice your height, you may replace one attack with a grapple. Make a STR + Phys roll opposed by an opponent's STR + Phys or DEX + Phys roll (their choice). If you succeed, the opponent is grappled, reducing their speed to 0, and your speed to half. Escaping the grapple requires an action and another set of opposed rolls.
  * **Shove**: You may shove a creature in order to knock them prone (adv. for melee, disadv. for ranged, half of movement to stand up), or push them away from you. Make a STR + Phys roll opposed by an opponent's STR + Phys or DEX + Phys roll (their choice).
* **Cover**: Cover adds to the AC and DEX saves of a creature, as follows:
  * **Half Cover**: +2
  * **3/4 Cover**: +5
  * **Full Cover**: untargetable by attacks and (most) spells

## Appendix B: Spell Lists

**Saving Throws and Scaling:** Unless a spell specifically mentions using a spell attack or not granting a saving throw, the target of a spell may resist by making an appropriate STR/DEX/MIND save. If a spell does damage, then successfully saving causes that spell to do half the damage it would have.

Many spells end with something like "+Xd6 per spell level above Yth." What this means is that the spell is Yth level spell, but if it is cast in a (Y+1)th level spell slot or higher it has some sort of scaling effect.

## Appendix C: Words of Power Spell System

All magic requires saying two words of power: an action and a realm. Every 1st level caster starts out knowing three words of power, but must know at least one action and one realm. They learn new Words of Power every three levels (3, 6, 9, etc.)

>  **Optional Rules**
>
> * **White and Black Magic**: Clerics draw their power from white magic, and may not use their magic to directly harm an individual. Mages draw their power from black magic and may not directly heal an individual.
> * **Elemental Specialization**: At the start of a day, a caster who knows the Energy realm must choose one particular type of damage (acid, fire, etc.) For that day, they may only use the Energy realm with relation to that type of damage. Alternatively, make a caster choose a damage type upon learning Energy - their magic is only capable of interacting with that type of energy.

### The Four Actions

* **Enhance** (augeo): Strengthen, Heal, Enlarge, Repair, Sharpen, etc.
* **Diminish** (infirmo): Weaken, Damage, Injure, Reduce, Break, Dull, Deteriorate, etc.
* **Communicate With** (defero): Sense, Read, Seek, Inform, Determine, Understand, etc.
* **Control** (tempero): Shape, Hold, Command, Form, Direct, Dictate, etc. (Control can only be learned after all other actions have been learned.)

### The Five Realms

* **Body** (corpus): Bodies of living things, plants.
* **Mind** (mentus): The thinking, feeling and conscious part of an entity.
* **Spirit** (animus): Essence or soul. (Spirit can only be learned after you have at least three Realms and three Actions.)
* **Energy** (navitas): Fire, liquid water, air, magic, electricity, and (optionally) time.
* **Matter** (materia): Solid, mindless material like stone, ice, metal, wood, leather, paper, etc.

If the caster is just trying to damage another creature, the caster makes a magic attack vs. AC. Otherwise, the creature must make a saving throw vs. the caster's spell DC. (The appropriate saving throw is decided by the GM. For example, dodging a fireball might be DEX, while resisting the effects of mind control might be MIND.)

**Damage and healing** starts at 3d6 at spell level 1, and increases by 3d6 every spell level.

For **other effects** besides simple damage and healing, roll damage starting at 2d6 at spell level 1, and increasing by 2d6 every spell level.

* If the target fails their saving throw, and their current HP is less than the damage rolled, they are instantly affected by the spell but take no damage.
* If the target fails their saving throw, and their current HP is greater than the damage rolled then they take the damage rolled but are not affected by the spell.
* If the target succeeds on their saving throw, they take half the damage rolled.

Positive effects used on willing targets bypass the need for saving throws, and immediately take effect. A creature can only be transformed into something of equal or lesser CR/level to themselves.

**Duration**: Spells that affect inanimate objects are generally permanent; an enlarged pebble will stay large, a broken belt will stay mended. Magically created fires, etc, will die down naturally. Living creatures will remain affected by a spell for 1 round per spell level of the spell that affected them. A caster may concentrate on a spell in order to keep the spell active longer. While concentrating, a caster may not cast any spells besides simple damage and healing spells or cantrips.

## Appendix D: Magic Items

To quickly make magic items, decide between a **spell item** which reproduces a spell from Appendices B or C, or a **bonus item** which provides a +1 to +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls (weapons), or AC (armor and shields.) All bonus items, and some spell items require **attunement slots**, which each character has 3 of.

There are three kinds of spell items:

* **Consumables**: Single use items such as potions or scrolls.
* **Renewable use** (Attunement): Contains charges that renew daily. Usually 3 charges a day, or 4 hours of effect per day.
* **Constant use** (Attunement): Provides a continuous effect.

Use the following guidelines when distributing items or estimating their price should the party try to sell them:

| Rarity    | Minimum Level | Value†     | Spell Levels | Armor | Weapon |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----- | ------ |
| Common    | 1st           | 100 gp     | Cantrip, 1st | -     | -      |
| Uncommon  | 1st           | 500 gp     | 2nd-3rd      | -     | +1     |
| Rare      | 5th           | 5000 gp    | 4th-5th      | +1    | +2     |
| Very Rare | 11th          | 50,000 gp  | 6th-8th      | +2    | +3     |
| Legendary | 17th          | 500,000 gp | 9th          | +3    | -      |

†Divide by 2 for renewable use, and 10 for consumables.

## Appendix E: Quick and Dirty Monsters

To make monsters on the fly, use the below rules:

1. Choose monster's Challenge Rating.
   	* **HP=** (5 x CR)d8 or 20 x CR
    * **AC=** 12 + prof. bonus (max 19)
    * **Save DC**= 12 + prof. bonus
    * **DPR** (Damage Per Round)= 8 + (6 x CR)
    * **Atk. Bonus**= 3 + prof. bonus
    * **Prof. Bonus**= Treat CR as level, and use proficiency bonus indicated in Advancement.
2. Adjust offensive (save DC, DPR, atk. bonus) and defensive stats (AC, HP) as desired. Treat the monster as having a higher CR for offensive or defensive stats. For every one CR you move up, you should move down one CR in the opposite kind of stat.
3. Choose a monster template. ("X DPR dmg", means "do X times DPR damage".)
   * **Aberration**: multiattack (two tentacles), tentacle (0.5 DPR dmg, STR save or paralyzed. If target is paralyzed and damage reduces target to 0 HP, target's brain is eaten.)
   * **Beast**: multiattack (claw and bite), claw (0.5 DPR dmg), bite (0.5 DPR dmg)
   * **Draconic**: breath weapon (DPR dmg, DEX save to avoid), bite (0.5 DPR dmg)
   * **Elemental**: smash (0.6 DPR dmg), death throes (when creature dies, make STR save or take 0.6 DPR dmg)
   * **Fey**: multiattack (two attacks), shillelagh/shortbow (0.5 DPR dmg), fey charm (MIND save or become friend for 24 hours), invisibility (lasts until it attacks or uses fey charm)
   * **Fiendish**: aura (at start of turn, 0.3 DPR dmg to all within 5 feet), trident (0.6 DPR dmg), fireball (0.6 DPR dmg)
   * **Giant**: punch (DPR dmg), boulder (DPR dmg)
   * **Undead**: multiattack (life drain and slam), life drain (0.4 DPR, STR save or reduce victim's max HP by dmg taken), slam (0.5 DPR)
   * **Vermin**: bite/sting (DPR damage, STR save or poisoned causing disadvantage on attacks), web/goo (DEX save or restrained)
4. Add any special abilities desired. (e.g. Flight or spellcasting.)
5. Add resistances (half damage from specific source) and immunities (not affected by specific source.) If you add many resistances or a few immunities, multiply hit points by the following values: CR 1-4 (0.5), CR 5-8 (0.7), CR 11-16 (0.8) CR 17+ (1)
   * **Physical damage types**: Slashing, piercing, bludgeoning.
   * **Magic damage types**: acid, fire, cold, poison, necrotic, radiant, lightning, psychic, thunder and force
   * **Condition immunities**: paralyzed, poisoned, charmed, etc.

## Appendix F: Boss Monsters

A boss monster can do things that ordinary creatures can't. Using its **legendary resistance** it can treat a failed saving throw as a success a certain number of times a day, and using its **legendary actions** it can act at the end of another creature's turn a certain number of times per round. The actions it can take in this way are as follows:

* **Costs 1 Action**: Make a Single Attack, Move, Cast a Cantrip
* **Costs 2 Actions**: Use a Special Ability, Cast a Spell, Multiattack

To turn an ordinary monster into a boss monster, pick a tier below (rounding CR down for initial CR 1/2 and lower):

| Tier      | Legendary Actions/round and Resistance/day | Hit Point  Increase | CR Increase |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Elite     | 1                                          | +20                 | +1          |
| Boss      | 2                                          | +30                 | +2          |
| Legendary | 3                                          | +40                 | +3          |
| Epic      | 4                                          | +50                 | +4          |

## Appendix G: Scaling Monsters

To scale monsters from the Bestiary, or the Fifth Edition Basic rules, simply determine what you want the new CR to be, and then use the below adjustments:

* **Prof. Bonus** = Treat CR as level, and use proficiency bonus indicated in Advancement.
* **ΔCR** = New CR - Old CR
* **HP** = +20 HP x ΔCR
* **DPR** = +6 dmg x ΔCR (remember to split for multiattacks)
* **ΔPB** = New Prof. Bonus - Old Prof. Bonus.
* **AC** = +ΔPB (max 19)
* **Save DC** = +ΔPB
* **Atk. Bonus** = +ΔPB

**Deadly abilities**: When scaling down creatures with fairly deadly abilities, it is also suggested that the severity of the condition is reduced. For example a medusa's petrifying gaze might just become a paralyzing gaze for a CR 1 medusa.
**Multiattack**: When scaling up, if the DPR increase ever (roughly) equals one of a creature's attacks consider giving the creature multiattack instead of just making their single attack twice as strong. When scaling down, if the DPR decrease ever (roughly) equals one of a creature's attacks, consider removing one of their attacks from their multiattack (or completely removing multiattack if the creature only has two attacks.)

## Appendix H: Quick Loot Tables

<small>(Taken from [this table](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/54stxb/the_1d6_loot_table/) by Justin McGuire. Used with permission.)</small>

Use the below steps to create a treasure horde belonging to a large group of creatures, or a single powerful creature.

### 1) Roll 1d6, or pick hoarder type

| 1d6  | Hoard Type                       | Contents                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | The Sentimental                  | 75 gold, 1 piece of art            |
| 2    | The Dilettante                   | 75 gold, 5 gems, 3 pieces of art   |
| 3    | The Traveler                     | 100 gold, 20 gems                  |

| 6    | The Old Horder                   | 300 gold, 15 gems, 6 pieces of art |


### 2) Make adjustments based on owner

**Monsters CR 0-4, commoner families, and simple merchants:**

## Appendix I: Random Dungeon Generation

If you don't have much time to prepare a dungeon in advance, use the following procedure:

1. Get a sheet of graph paper. (Non-graph paper will do in a pinch.)
2. Grab a handful of d6s.
3. Roll the dice all at once and let them land where they will on the paper. (It may help to have a box to keep the dice constrained to the paper.)
4. Everywhere a d6 lands is a room. (Assign room dimensions to taste.) The number of exits from that room is based on the value of the d6:
   * 1-2: 1 exit; 3-4: 2 exits; 5-6: 3 exits.
